Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful image models that can learn probability distribution over images.
The goal of thisproject is to apply the technology to multi channel fluorescence microscopy images.
Fluorescence microscopy allows us to highlight multiple parts of the living cell in different colour channels.
However, the number of channels that can be imaged at the same time is limmited.
A generative model could help to mittigate this limmitations.

The aims of the project are
* Train a GAN on multichannel fluorescence microscopy data
* Find a way to evaluate the quality of theimages
* Try to train GANs from incomplete data, that is when some of the channels are missing in parts of the training data.
